## Overview
This repository contains code for a machine learning project completed during my internship at Bharat Intern. The project focuses on two main tasks: SMS classification and Titanic classification. In the SMS classification task, the goal is to classify SMS messages into different categories (e.g., spam or ham). In the Titanic classification task, the aim is to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on various features.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, etc. (See requirements.txt for details)

## Usage
1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   cd your-repository
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Open and run the Jupyter Notebooks (`sms_classifier.ipynb` and `titanic_classifier.ipynb`) to see the code and results.

## Results
- Detailed analysis and results can be found within the Jupyter Notebooks.
